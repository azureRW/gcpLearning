this is a node to record some problem I encounter when I learn gcp    
    IaaS vs PaaS ->
        infrastructure as a service vs platform as a service

development:
    gcp provide serials tool such as gutbucket lab..
    Terraform : a tool for build application environment template via HashiCorp Configure Language
        infrastructure as code (IaC) tool 
        <- kind of like dockerFile in docker but for infrastructure
======================================================

GCP storage:
    GCP provides three types of storage operations: object storage, persistent
    local and attached storage, and relational and NoSQL databases.

    Google Cloud Storage (GCS) :
        is an object or binary storage system designed for 
        persisting unstructured data such as data files, images, videos, backup files
        and any other data. There are several region types and classes to choose from,
        such as mono region, dual region, and multiple region, and classes based on access 
        frequency (Standard, Nearline, Coldline, and Archive).
    
    Cloud Filestore :
        is a network-attached storage service that provides a file system 
        accessible from Compute Engine and Kubernetes Engine.
    
    Cloud SQL :
        is a managed database that provides a MySQL and PostgreSQL server. 
        It can only scale vertically.
    
    Cloud Spanner :
        is a managed SQL database that supports horizontal scaling and scale globally.
    
    BigQuery :
        is a managed analytics service that uses SQL language to query data. 
        It can handle large amounts of data (TB or PB) and return information via fuzzy matching.
    
    Cloud Bigtable 
        is a PB-scale NoSQL and key-value database for analytic operations, 
        such as IOT services and ML. It has follower features, low latency, 
        PB-scale, regional replication, specific commands, and supports Hadoop and HBase.
        but! it so not support transaction.
    
    Cloud Datastore     
        is a managed document database that uses a flexible 
        JSON-like data structure called a document.
    
    Cloud Memorystore 
        is a managed Redis service, which is an open-source 
        in-memory data store.
    
    Firestore(next generation cloud data store) :
        is a NoSQL document database for mobile, web and iot apps at global scale.
        It also support ACID transaction and multi-region replication.
        If our data lager than 1 tb google recommend us to use Cloud Bigtable.

======================================================

network:

    Virtual Private Clouds(VPC) :
        Like a network in data center but it actually has not regional limitation.
        It can span multiple regions. For example, we can ping another instance in EU from USA as like a 
        local area network if there are in a same project or organization.

        VPC Subnets:
            A VPC can have subnets in each region in order to provide private addresses to 
            resources in the region.
       
        Shared VPC:
            Sometimes, we have to share resources between different projects. And gcp provides a service
            called 'Shared VPCs' to accomplish this kind of demand.

        VPC network Peering:
            VPC network peering enables different VPC networks to communicate using private IP
            address space. It uses VPN. There are 3 advantages of VPC network peering :
                . lower latency because the traffic stays in Google network.
                . reduce the attack surface from outer network
                . no egress charges
            * VPC network peering can connect VPCs between organization which Shared VPC can't.

        Firewall Rules:
            The #num of rules means the priority, the larger rules will be override by smaller one.
            Rules are global resources that are assigned to VPCs, so they can be ued to control traffic
            between regions in a VPC.

        IP & CIDR(classes inter-domain routing) blocks:
            nothing special


    Hybrid-Cloud Networking:
        When 2 or more public clouds are linked together, that is called a multi-cloud network.
        It is often used for data transportation between clouds or on-premises data center and cloud.


        Hybrid-Cloud Design Considerations:
            . The network has to be have adequate if the workloads run in different environments. For 
            example, A cloud instance may use data from a on-premises data sources.
            . We also have to consider about the latency. Sometimes, we need to call COBOL system which
            is a pice of shit and we have to be certain that round-trip time transmitting data must be low
            enough to meet the SLA.
            . Reliability is a concern, A single network interconnect can become a single point of failure.
            If the cost of maintaining 2 or more interconnect is acceptable we should use it.

        Hybrid-Cloud Implementation Options:
            Cloud VPN 
                is a security process to encrypted the data between two networks.
            Cloud Interconnect 
                provides high throughput and highly available networking between
                GCP abd on-premises networks. The data is transmit via google private network, so we don't
                need to care about the security problem, but the drawback is that cost is expensive so if low
                latency and high availability is not required then Cloud VPN is the better option.
            Direct Peering
                is a network configuration using Border Gateway Protocol routes.

    Load Balancing :

        Generally, GCP provides regional and global, 2 types of load balancers.
                


    
======================================================
Cloud IM (security)
    The hierarchy in gcp from high is started with organization, folders, projects, resources.
    Generally organization is the node of whole structure or tree, which normally represents
    your company. And the folders can be the representation of your departments.

    gcp basic roles:
        Owner: Owner has full administrative that includes remove members and delete projects.
        Editor: The editor role has modify and delete access.
        Viewer: read-only
        Billing Administrator: manage billing and add or removing administrators
            ps: Owner has all privilege Editor has and Edit also has all privilege Viewer has.
            Basic roles have their own specific privilege in different services(network, storage, engine).
            GCP still provides an another flexible way to let company authorize their employees -- 
            Custom Roles (list base).

     Members:
        google account: as its name a google account
        
        service account: is a account for applications instead of end user 
        
        google groups: is a named of collection of google accounts and service accounts
        
        google workspace domains: represent your organization's internet domain name
        
        cloud identity domains: Google Cloud customers who are not Workspace customers 
            can get these same capabilities through Cloud Identity. 
    
    IM resource hierarchy:
        A policy is a collection of access statements attached to resources.
        Each policy contains a set of roles and role members
